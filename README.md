# Network Attack Detection using Machine Learning

### Goal
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that is able to detect and classify network attacks. The model will be trained using a dataset of network flows, and will be able to predict if a new flow is an attack or not, and if it is, what kind of attack it is.

### Phase-1
