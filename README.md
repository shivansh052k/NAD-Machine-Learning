# Network Attack Detection using Machine Learning

### Goal of the Project
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that is able to detect and classify network attacks. The model will be trained using a dataset of network flows, and will be able to predict if a new flow is an attack or not, and if it is, what kind of attack it is.

### Dataset Description

The dataset used for this project is written in the NetFlow V9 format (format by Cisco, documentation available here). The dataset is composed by two files:

<ul>
  <li>train_set: ~4 million flows, used for training the model</li>
  <li>test_set: ~2 million flows, used for testing the model</li>
</ul>
